            <li>
                <p>Put egg whites into a bowl. Use egg beater at low speed until large bubbles appear, add salt and cream of tartar. Continue to beat until bubbles become smaller, mixture is smooth and same like soap bubbles, add sugar.</p></li>
                <p>At the same time, add sugar slowly and beat egg whites at high speed. Continue until mixture becomes solid and smoother, slow the beater down.</p>
                <p>Eggs need beating until it becomes a smooth paste, not too hard. When you lift the stick, it should have a cone shape of egg paste.</p>

                <p><em>Note: to make sponge cake delicious, egg whites should be kept in medium room’s temperature which does not contain impurities such as butter, cooking oil, yolks. – A bowl and stick should be cleaned and dry, no butter, cooking oil and yolks…</em></p>
            <li>Turn on beater at low speed. Put each yolk, beat well (this step may take 5 to 10 seconds). After all, you can see a smooth paste with yellowish color.</li>

            <li>Divide flour into 2-3 parts. Sift each part into a bowl. Mix them (it takes 10-15 seconds to beat each part). You should sift carefully so that flour spread even on the surface of bowls, which helps you beat faster.</li>

                <p>Note: you should not beat too long, because it makes bubbles burst, and sponge cakes would be hard and difficult to bloom.</p>
            <li>
                <p>Line a piece of parchment paper or white paper at the bottom of the pan to make cakes. Pour the flour into the mold.</p>
                <p>Tap the mold on the table a few times to make the foam burst. Bring to grill at 175 degrees C or 165 degrees C, two rounds for 25-35 minutes. Cooked cake is that when you gently press on the cake, you see the dent immediately inflates again.</p></li>
