    <h4><em>Japchae or chapchae (잡채) is a very popular Korean dish. It is the number one sought after dish particularly during the Korean festive holidays (e.g. New Year’s day and Harvest festival) but it is also enjoyed on any other common day as well.

        <p>Japchae translates as mixed vegetables. When it was first invented in the 17th century, japchae was a noodle-less dish.</p>
        
        <p>But nowadays, the main highlight of the dish is glass noodles, which is made from sweet potatoes, along with colorful vegetables and well seasoned meat.</p></em></h4>
