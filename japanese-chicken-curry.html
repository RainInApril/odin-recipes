        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <h4>To Prepare the Ingredients</h4>
            <li>Discard the extra fat from the chicken and cut it into bite size pieces. Season with a little bit of salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Peel and cut the carrot in rolling wedges (Rangiri) and cut the onions in wedges.</li>
            <li>Cut the potatoes into 1 ½ inch (4 cm) pieces and soak in water for 15 minutes to remove excess starch.</li>
            <li>Grate the ginger and crush the garlic.</li>
            </ol>

           <ol>
            <h4>To Cook the Curry</h4>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat and sauté the onions until they become translucent and tender.</li>
            <li>Add the ginger and garlic.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken and cook until it's no longer pink.</li>
            <li>Add the carrot and mix well to coat with oil.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken broth and bring it to a boil. Chicken broth contains a different amount of salt. If you're careful with sodium intake or not sure if your chicken stock is too salty, you can use <strong>water only</strong>, or use <strong>half stock + half water</strong>. You can always add salt at the end of cooking.</li>
            <li>Once boiling, using a fine-mesh strainer, skim the scrum and fat from the surface of the broth.</li>
            <li>Peel the apple and grate it (use as much as you like to add sweetness). I've been using this grater and love it.</li>
            <li>Add the honey and salt and simmer uncovered for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Add the potatoes and cook until the potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
            <h4>To Add the Curry Roux</h4>
            <li>Turn off the heat. If you use the store-bought curry roux, put 1-2 blocks of roux in a ladle and slowly let it dissolve with a spoon or chopsticks. Continue with the rest of the blocks.</li>
            <li>If you're using homemade curry roux, scoop a ladleful or two of cooking liquid from the curry broth and add it into the curry paste in a saucepan. Add more cooking liquid if necessary and mix well until it’s smooth.</li>
            <li>Add the roux mixture back into the soup and stir to combine.</li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
            <h4>To Season the Curry</h4>
            <li>Add soy sauce and ketchup (and any other condiments you're adding – see the blog post). Simmer uncovered on low heat, stirring occasionally, until the curry becomes thick.</li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
            <h4>To Serve</h4>
            <li>Serve the curry with Japanese rice on the side. If you like, garnish with soft-boiled egg and fukujinzuke. </li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
            <h4>To Store</h4>
            <li>You can keep the leftovers in a glass airtight container (so no stain!) and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days and in the freezer for a month. Potatoes will change the texture so you can take them out before freezing. When you reheat, add ¼-½ cup (60-120 ml) water to dilute the curry.</li>
        </ol>
